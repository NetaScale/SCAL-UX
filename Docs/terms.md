In place of some terms often used on Unix-like systems, these replacements are
used:

 - "Exit acknowledgment" replaces 'reaping'
 - "To send a signal" (or 'to signal' for short) replaces "to kill". A process
    which has been sent a signal such as to end the process is a
   "signalled process".
 - "Completed process" replaces "zombie process". 
 - "Subprocess" replaces "child process"
 - "Superprocess" replaces "parent process"
